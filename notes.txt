flow of data

the game renders its new content bascially from objects and arrays that contain data.
I want my player object to hold all the values that need to be ran everytime something in the state changes.
This means that I will build objects that hold information that can change via the user inputs
    once the objects are built, a render state function should be called everytime the user interacts with the page.
    for example I could have a player object which reads...
    
    let player = {
        name: 'Marcus',
        img: 'main.jpg,
        attack: 3,
        range: 2,
        speed: 3,
        location: 0,
        color: 'blue',
        deck: {
            draw: [],
            hand: [],
            discard: []
        }
        head: {name: 'Elvish Crown'},
        gloves: {name: 'Gauntlet of Power'},
        weapon: {name: 'Adamantine'},
        shoes: {name: 'Boots of speed'},
        belt: {name: 'King's Purse'},
        mount: {name: 'Dragon'},
    }
