flow of data

-modal (how many players? 1,2,3,4,5)

-choose
-name, speed, range, damage, picture, (add relic later)

these values then become arguments for a function createPlayer(name:string, range: int, damage: int, picture: img)

createPlayer needs to then take those values and build the following object of data

    function createPlayer(...args) {
        let player = {
            name:args[0],
            level: 1,
            speed: args[1],
            range: args[2], 
            damage: args[3], 
            picture: args[4],
            position: 0,
            deck: {
                draw-pile: [],
                hande-pile: [],
                discard-pile: []
            }
            remainingAttacks: 0,
            remainingMovements: 0,
            remainingDraws: 5,

        }
    }

    const playerOne = createPlayer(...args)

    const playerTwo = createPlayer(...args)
    const playerThree = createPlayer(...args)
    const playerFour = createPlayer(...args)
    const playerFive = createPlayer(...args)
    
const playerArray = [playerOne, playerTwo, playerThree, plyerFour, playerFive]

CARDS
 Each card will carry a description and at leats one function...

    class CardCreator {
        constructor(...args) generalCard = {
            name = this.args[0]
            description = this.args[1]
            cost = this.args[2]
        }
        
        cardSideEffect() {

        }
        .
        .
        .
        sideEffects
    }



that 



players = [...players]
enemies = [...enemies]

take all the data from the players and enemies arrays and create the game state at round 1.1

board and playmat is displayed => function displayGame(a,b)



functions and variables on gameboard

//during player phase
    let position
    move()
    attack()

//during clean-up phase
    positionAtEndOfTurn( position ) => updates specific player's location on the board.

    

const round1.1 = {
    round: 1,
    turn: 1,
    players: [...args],
    enemies: [...args]
}





1. get data to store for round 1.1

2. get 




Notes outside of coding I had no better place to write it:
    1. Relational conflict in a certain context, is the process of two people trying to 'fit into' each others' lives. This 'fitting' is a more abstract symbol for sex, or more appropriately 'intercourse'. This fitting in then, by reason, should be able to produce a type of offspring (again abstractly). Conflict is the name of one of these children.
