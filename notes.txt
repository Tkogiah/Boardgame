flow of data

-modal (how many players? 1,2,3,4,5)

-choose
-name, speed, range, damage, picture, (add relic later)

these values then become arguments for a function createPlayer(name:string, range: int, damage: int, picture: img)

createPlayer needs to then take those values and build the following object of data


Notes outside of coding I had no better place to write it:
    1. Relational conflict in a certain context, is the process of two people trying to 'fit into' each others' lives. This 'fitting' is a more abstract symbol for sex, or more appropriately 'intercourse'. This fitting in then, by reason, should be able to produce a type of offspring (again abstractly). Conflict is the name of one of these children.
